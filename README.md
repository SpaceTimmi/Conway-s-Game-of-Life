# Rules (courtsey of wikipedia)

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neigbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neigbours becomes a live cell as if by reproduction.
